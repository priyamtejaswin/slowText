# slowText

Welcome to `slowText`.

Ever wanted a version of `fastText` that was not as fast? Yes? Well, you've reached the right place.

This is my attempt to see how far I can push Python code, 
inspired by [Gensim's word2vec](https://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-in-python-part-two-optimizing/) port in `Python` which is faster than the OG `C` implementation.
